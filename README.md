## Overview
This professional portfolio presents a **pre-implementation design package** for the *Ethiopia Maternal Mortality Reduction Initiative (EMMRI)* — a proposed five-year effort aimed at reducing maternal mortality through capacity building, strengthened community health systems, and improved data governance.  

Each artifact illustrates project readiness in the domains of strategic planning, training design, data quality assurance, ethical compliance, and monitoring & evaluation (M&E) framework development. The materials adhere to **WHO and USAID-aligned standards** for maternal health and project management.
